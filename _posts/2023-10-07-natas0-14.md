Welcome to overthewire's natas web security 1-33 walkthrough 
Where2play: https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/


**natas0**
http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
username:natas0
password:natas0


When logged in the site is says **"You can find the password for the next level on this page."** so lets check page source.
There is a commented line in page source basically tells us the pass : **"The password for natas1 is g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6"**

**natas1**
username:natas1
password:g9D9cREhslqBKtcA2uocGHPfMZVzeFK6

Disabled right click hmm... but there is another way to view page source change **http://** with **view-source:** and there it is another comment line **The password for natas2 is h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7**

**natas2**
username:natas2
password:h4ubbcXrWqsTo7GGnnUMLppXbOogfBZ7

There is nothing in this page as it says but when i check page source there is pixel.png file from /files folder so lets check it 
**http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/** there is natas3 user and pass in users.txt

**natas3**
username:natas3
password:G6ctbMJ5Nb4cbFwhpMPSvxGHhQ7I6W8Q

Again it says there is nothing in this page but in page source there is a hint. It says "even google cant find it" that means its blocked in robots.txt lets check it.
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt 
in robots.txt file /s3cr3t path is disallowed. lets check path this time http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t aand there it is users.txt file which contains natas4:pass..

**natas4**
username:natas4
password:tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm

Page says
**Access disallowed. You are visiting from "" while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"** 
that means who requested to connect natas4 in terminology this named as "referer". Lets try something: **curl -referer**. As curl exists other tools available for http referring (owasp zap etc.).

{% highlight bash%}
curl -u natas4:tKOcJIbzM4lTs8hbCmzn5Zr4434fGZQm --referer http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
{%endhighlight%}

**natas5** username: natas5 password: Z0NsrtIkJoKALBCLi5eqFfcRN82Au2oD

**Access disallowed. You are not logged in** lets check requests with burp. When i intercepted connection with burp proxy there is a "loggedin=0" cookie value so just i changed parameter with "loggedin=1" and logged in.

**natas6** username: natas6 password: fOIvE0MDtPTgRhqmmvvAOt2EfXR6uQgR

When login a textbox welcomes me and a source code button lets check source code.
{%highlight php%}

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>






{%highlight python%}
print("sa")
{% endhighlight %}
